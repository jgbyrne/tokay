// Tests for parsing and packrat features ---------------------------------------------------------

/*
    Below are some tests that provide indirect left-recursion.

    They currently don't work properly due to the following reason:
    For indirect left-recursion in packrat parsing, one rule in the
    grammar's graph must be declared as "leading", so that subsequent,
    even left-recursive parselets are considered as not left-recursive.


    An implementation of an solution for this issue can be found in
    the pegen parser generator from Python:

    https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Tools/peg_generator/pegen/parser_generator.py

    Tokay won't take care of this right now as it is an edge-case
    and also more complex, as Tokay does not directly implements a
    grammar.
