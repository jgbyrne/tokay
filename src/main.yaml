    {all-args}

    Program and input arguments are either loaded from a file if a file with
    specified name exists, otherwise they are used directly as input. Use '-f'
    to disable this behavior. Specify '-' to use stdin as input file.

    When no arguments are specified, {bin} turns into an interactive REPL.
