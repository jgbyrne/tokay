# Changelog

## [main]

Current main branch.

- Self-hosted tokay parser in `examples/tokay.tok`
- JSON parser in `examples/json.tok`
- Entire redesign of value system and objects
  - New Object trait
  - Splitting `enum Value` into separate objects using `Box<dyn Object>`
  - `unary_op()` and `binary_op()` for RefValue, with fast-lanes for some operations
  - Replacement of separate binary- and unary-VM instructions into `Op::BinaryOp` and `Op::UnaryOp`
  - Implemented all primary operations by builtin methods
- Entire redesign of builtins using proc-macro
- Builtin registry generated by a build-script, substituting inventory or linkme
- Improved Tokay parser newline behavior to support for Windows and classic Mac line ending
- Moved tests from test.rs to their specific locations, so tests are written next to their implementation
- Read from stdin when no input stream but a program was specified
- New builtins
  - `repr()` to get string with Tokay object representation
  - `type()` to get string of Tokay value type
  - bool methods: `bool()`
  - int methods: `int()`
  - float methods: `float()`
  - addr methods: `addr()`
  - dict methods: `dict()`, `dict.update()`
  - list methods: `list()`, `list.add()`, `list.iadd()`, `list.push()`
  - str methods: `str()`, `str.add()`, `str.endswith()`, `str.mul()`, `str.join()`, `str.lower()`, `str.replace()`, `str.startswith()`, `str.upper()`
