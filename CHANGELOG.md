# Changelog

## [main]

Current main branch.

- Entire redesign of value system and objects
  - New `Object` trait
  - Splitting `enum Value` into separate objects using `Box<dyn Object>`
  - `unary_op()` and `binary_op()` for RefValue, with fast-lanes for some operations
  - Replacement of separate binary- and unary-VM instructions into `Op::BinaryOp` and `Op::UnaryOp`
  - Implemented all primary operations by builtin methods
- Builtins
  - Entire redesign of builtins using proc-macro
  - Builtin function registry generated by a build-script, substituting `inventory`/`linkme`-crates
  - New builtin functions
    - `repr()` to get string with Tokay object representation
    - `type()` to get string of Tokay value type
    - bool methods: `bool()`
    - int methods: `int()`
    - float methods: `float()`, `float.ceil()`, `float.fract()`, `float.trunc()`
    - addr methods: `addr()`
    - dict methods: `dict()`, `dict.len()`, `dict.update()`
    - list methods: `list()`, `list.add()`, `list.iadd()`, `list.len()`, `list.push()`
    - str methods: `str()`, `str.add()`, `str.byteslen()` `str.endswith()`, `str.mul()`, `str.join()`, `str.len()`, `str.lower()`, `str.replace()`, `str.startswith()`, `str.upper()`
  - Improved builtin `Integer` allowing for different parsing options (`base`, `with_signs`)
  - New builtin `Float` allowing for parsing floating point numbers into float values
- Improved Tokay parser newline behavior to support Windows and classic Mac line ending as well
- Moved tests from `test.rs` into their particular locations, so tests are written next to their implementation.
- Read from stdin when no input stream but a program was specified
- New example files
  - Self-hosted Tokay parser in `examples/tokay.tok`
  - Simple JSON parser in `examples/json.tok`
